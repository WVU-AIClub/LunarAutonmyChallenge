# Lunar Autonomy Challenge 🚀🌙

Proud to share that our team placed 5th in the Lunar Autonomy Challenge — among a very competitive lineup of teams from across the country! 🎉

This repository contains our work for the challenge, where we designed and tested autonomous navigation strategies for a simulated lunar rover environment.

## 🛰️ About the Challenge

The Lunar Autonomy Challenge, hosted by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), brought together teams to develop cutting-edge autonomy solutions for robotic exploration in lunar-like environments.

Our task: create an autonomous system capable of navigating, perceiving, and making decisions in simulated lunar terrain.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

Over the course of the competition, we built and experimented with:

ROS (Robot Operating System) for robot control and communication

Computer Vision for navigation and terrain understanding

Reinforcement Learning for autonomous decision-making under uncertainty

Multi-user Linux Server Setup to streamline development and collaboration
